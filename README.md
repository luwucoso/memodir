# Memodir

I have no idea if this is blazingly fast or not but
memodir is a small and simple command line utility (CLI)
to remember selected directories and query them,
the output can easily be piped into other commands to
cd into a directory for instance.

## Install

Clone the repository, use go 1.24, go install, memodir should
be ready to use!

## Use

For a small explanation message run: memodir .help
