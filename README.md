# Memodir

I have no idea if this is blazingly fast or not but
memodir is a small and simple command line utility (CLI)
to remember selected directories and query them,
the output can easily be piped into other commands to
cd into a directory for instance.

## Install

Clone the repository, use go 1.23, go install, memodir should
be ready to use!

for nix, check the [nix installation guide](https://github.com/sawcce/memodir/Nix_Installation.md)

## Use

For a small explanation message run: memodir .help
